# komorebi
Komorebi is a vector-assisted, schemaless cognitive infrastructure for high-pressure operations. It automates "messy chunk" ingestion, recursive context summarization, and modular MCP aggregation to eliminate organizational debt. Built with FastAPI and React, it turns fragmented terminal logs and tasks into actionable intelligence.
